# Portfolio-Website-Built-with-HTML-and-CSS-

Excited to share my latest web development internship project: TASK 2 Complete !!🎉

A fully responsive personal portfolio website built with HTML and CSS!

This project was a fantastic learning experience, covering everything from creating a sleek layout to styling elements for an engaging user experience. Some highlights:

Clean, Simple Navigation: Built with a user-focused design to make it easy to explore.

Personal Touch: Sections like “About Me,” “Skills,” “Projects,” and “Contact” showcase my skills and background.
